<h3>HTML</h3>
<p><b>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</b>
is the standard <a href="https://www.google.com/">markup language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <br>
It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often <i>assisted</i> by technologies such as Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>
<p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of
a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</p>
<h3>SEJARAH</h3>
<p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE,
a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989 ,<br> Berners-Lee wrote a memo
proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">[3]</a></sup> Berners-Lee<br> specified HTML and wrote the browser
and server software in late <sub><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">1990</a></sub>. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
collaborated on a joint request for funding,<br> but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his
personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext
is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[4]</p>
